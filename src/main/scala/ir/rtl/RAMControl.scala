  case Single /// Write address is the same as the read address, delayed by a constant time. This uses less resources, but it has less flexibility: a dataset must be input either immediately after the previous one, or wait that the previous dataset is completely out.
  case SinglePorted /// Write and read addresses are the same (single-ported memory). This has the same constraints as Single, but may have a higher latency.
